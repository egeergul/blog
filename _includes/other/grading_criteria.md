## Personal Grading Criteria

I have adopted a new grading criterion for the comic books and graphic novels that I read. This criterion is solely for my personal taste in comics and will continue to evolve as my preferences change over time. Therefore, I am adding versioning to my criteria as well. For each entry, I will specify the grading criteria version that I am using.

### GC1 (Grading Criteria 1)

- Line Art & Inking (3 pts)
- Coloring (2 pts)
- Line Art & Coloring Coherence (1 pt)
- Art Style Consistency (1 pt)
- Story (3 pts)
- Narrative (2 pts)
- Pre & Post Requirements (1pts)

Total points: 13

_Line Art & Coloring Coherence_: In some comics, the line artist and the coloring artist are different people. Sometimes, their work does not blend well to create a cohesive piece of art, which annoys me. This criterion penalizes such cases.

_Art Style Consistency_: Some comic books contain multiple issues, and when each issue has a different artist (or group of artists), it disrupts the visual flow, which I find frustrating. This criterion penalizes such inconsistencies.

_Pre & Post Requirements_: In Marvel and DC comics, a story arc can sometimes begin at issue #600, yet a book labeled as issue #1 might not make sense without prior knowledge. Similarly, a series might seem complete but actually continue in another series. I dislike these situations, so this criterion penalizes such cases.
