## 15-03-2025 / Monica by Daniel Clowes -> 70/100

**ðŸ¤” Hmm...**

I just finished reading _Monica_ by Daniel Clowes (2023), and I want to jump straight into grading it.

### **Line Art & Inking: 2/3 pts**

A classic, old-fashioned retro comic style. Clean, tidy lines. No sloppy work. I like it. Itâ€™s solid but nothing exceptional, so I wonâ€™t give it a full 3/3.

### **Coloring: 2/2 pts**

I love when comics use single-layer coloringâ€”no excessive shading or highlighting, just a clean, two-dimensional aesthetic. The color choices are exceptionalâ€”vibrant yet unsettling, perfectly capturing the story's eerie tone. A masterful job. **2/2.**

### **Line Art & Coloring Coherence: 1/1 pt**

Shading is primarily handled through inking, while the coloring stays consistent without adding extra depth or shadows. I appreciate when the coloring style aligns seamlessly with the line art. Full points.

### **Art Style Consistency: 1/1 pt**

The drawing style shifts occasionally, but not in a jarring way. It feels like an intentional choice, adapting subtly to the story's needs. Instead of being distracting, it enhances the narrative. I actually liked this approach, so full points.

### **Story: 1.5/3 pts**

I have no idea what the hell just happened. Something insane is definitely going on. When I looked up explanations online, I confirmed that, yesâ€”something _insane_ is going on.

From the moment I started reading, I felt nervous. The atmosphere was unsettling, even spooky. Any comic that can evoke such strong emotions is, by definition, a success.

_Buuut_â€”I wasnâ€™t in the right mood for it. Today, I wanted a light, easy read. This completely caught me off guard. I donâ€™t enjoy finishing a book only to immediately search online to understand it.

So, right story, wrong time. **1.5/3.**  
(_What are you gonna do about it? This is my blog, so of course, I grade subjectively._)

### **Narrative: 1/2 pts**

Technically, the storytelling is solid. There are no ambiguous illustrations (i.e., scenes where you donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happening until several pages later). Paneling and speech bubbles are well-structuredâ€”no confusing reading orders.

Story-wise, the narrative keeps you on edge. Youâ€™re never quite sure if whatâ€™s happening is real or part of a fictional construct. I assume thatâ€™s exactly what Clowes intended, and he executes it well.

That said, sometimes this approach gets exhausting. For example, _The Glow Infernal_ felt like a completely out-of-context chapter. It made zero sense to me while reading, and only after looking it up did I realize it was probably a story Monica had written. The same goes for _The Incident_.

I get that the disorienting, unreliable storytelling is intentionalâ€”it effectively creates an eerie, dreamlike atmosphereâ€”but today, it just didnâ€™t work for me. **1/2.**

### **Pre & Post Requirements: 0.5/1 pts**

No pre-requirementsâ€”thankfully, you donâ€™t need to read 15 other books (_looking at you, Marvel_). However, there _is_ a post-requirement: to fully grasp the story, you need to research it afterward. To truly appreciate it, you probably have to re-read it.

So, **0.5/1** for me.

## **Conclusion: 70/100**

Overall, _Monica_ scored **9/13**, which translates to **69.23/100**. But Iâ€™ll be generous and round it up by **0.77 points**â€”so the final grade is **70/100**.

I know thatâ€™s probably not the score it deserves. But againâ€”right story, wrong person, wrong time. Also, this is my first attempt at grading a comic book, so maybe I botched it. _Sue me._

Thanks for reading my blog. See you next time! ðŸ‘‹
