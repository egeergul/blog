## 16-03-2025 / Hawkeye by Matt Fraction -> 115/100

**Groundbreaking ðŸŽ¯**

I've been re-reading Hawkeye (2012â€“2015) by Matt Fraction, and without a doubt, it stands as one of the greatest comic runs ever created. In this entry, Iâ€™ll break down exactly why. Honestly, these comics get me so excited that this might end up being the longest entry I ever writeâ€”so buckle up!

This 22-issue, unconventional Hawkeye series follows the adventures of Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Kate Bishop (also Hawkeye) outside of their work with the Avengers. The first half of the story focuses on Clint Bartonâ€™s chaotic personal life and his ongoing conflict with the Russian mafia over the apartment building he calls home. The second half shifts to Kate Bishop, who sets off on her own journey of self-discovery, trying to carve out her own identity. In the end, both narratives converge in a powerful and satisfying conclusion.

### **Line Art & Inking: 3/3 pts**

Throughout the series, multiple artists contributed to the line art:

- **David Aja** (#1â€“3, #6, #8â€“9, #11, #13, #15, #19, #21â€“22)
- **Annie Wu** (#14, #16, #18, #20)
- **Javier Pulido** (#4â€“5)
- **Francesco Francavilla** (#10, #12)
- **Chris Eliopoulos** (#17)
- **Steve Lieber & Jesse Hamm** (#7)

Wow... thatâ€™s a lot of artists. Itâ€™s fair to say that David Aja is the main artist, andâ€”boy, isnâ€™t he brilliant? His style is **magnificent**. He comes up with so many revolutionary and creative ways to tell a story through comicsâ€”itâ€™s insane. But weâ€™ll get to that later.

To be honest, aside from Ajaâ€™s work, I didnâ€™t particularly enjoy the other artistsâ€™ line art. However, Ajaâ€™s unique style is exceptionally good and serves as the defining visual identity of the series. Because of that, Iâ€™m giving the line art a solid **3/3**.

### **Coloring: 2/2 pts**

Once again, multiple artists contributed to the coloring throughout the series. However, the primary coloristâ€”especially for Ajaâ€™s workâ€”is **Matt Hollingsworth**, and his work is _insane_. Iâ€™ll explore his masterful use of color in more detail later on.

![Issue 1](assets/images/16-03-2025/i9.png)

Take a look at these two pages from _Issue #1_. In this issue, the story jumps back and forth in time. Typically, comics rely on descriptive text like _"Later..."_ or _"Previously..."_ to indicate time shifts. But Aja and Hollingsworth pull it off purely through color.

The identical shot of Clintâ€”same angle, same expressionâ€”but with different clothing and background colors immediately signals a time jump. From the context of the story, we can deduce whether itâ€™s a flashback or a leap forward. **Brilliant!**

Additionally, the color palette that Hollingsworth introduced from _Issue #1_ is absolutely stunning. The soft, pastel-toned shades of purple are used masterfully throughout the series. I love the way the colors keep the comic dynamic while enhancing the emotions being conveyed.

This is an easy **2/2** for me.

### **Line Art & Coloring Coherence: 1/1 pt**

With so many different combinations of line artists and colorists working together throughout the series, addressing each pairing individually would be nearly impossible. So, Iâ€™ll focus on the collaboration between the **main line artist (David Aja)** and the **main colorist (Matt Hollingsworth)**.

They work together **brilliantly**! Aja incorporates necessary hard shadows within his line art, and Hollingsworth respects this by not adding any additional shading layers. Instead, Aja leaves the soft shadowing to Hollingsworth, who executes it **excellently**. Their styles complement each other perfectly, making for a seamless and cohesive visual experience.

**1/1**

### **Art Style Consistency: 0/1 pt**

As I mentioned previously, multiple artists worked on this series. However, there is a clear logic behind this decision.

- **David Aja** illustrates the main story focusing on Clint Barton and his conflicts with the Russian mafia.
- **Javier Pulido** draws issues #4â€“5, which tell an alternative story independent of the main narrative.
- **Annie Wu** handles the solo adventures of Kate Bishop.
- **Steve Lieber & Jesse Hamm** pencil issue #7, which centers around Gil (a side character) and his father.

So, as you can see, each storyline has its own dedicated artist. When you think about it, this approach makes senseâ€”each character experiences the story from their own perspective, and a different artist helps reflect that unique viewpoint.

_But_, itâ€™s really frustrating. I absolutely love Ajaâ€™s style, and I just canâ€™t get enough of it. So when I turn the page and see a completely different art style, it pulls me out of the experience. Worse, some of the other artists' work feels rushed, bringing down the comicâ€™s otherwise **flawless** execution.

Just look at this page from _Issue #4_:

![Issue 4](assets/images/16-03-2025/i1.png)

The **reading order** of the first three panels is completely **wrong**!

Dude, you are a professional comic book artist who gets paid per page. How could you not notice that the panel layout disrupts the natural reading flow? It's a total buzzkill.

Overall, I understand that there is **some** consistency in the art style throughout the series, and at least the changes seem intentional. But personally, I donâ€™t think it worked **well**. So itâ€™s a **0/1** for me.

### **Story: 3/3 pts**

The story is **incredibly engaging**. If there were a TV show based on the events of this series (which, by the way, there is), it would totally be a hit. _(Unfortunately, the adaptation wasnâ€™t as successful since it was only **partially** based on the series.)_

The plot is **lightweight, easy to follow, and packed with action**. At the same time, it includes touching moments featuring Hawkeyeâ€™s neighbors, showing glimpses of his everyday life. I love these minor detailsâ€”they emphasize that Clint Barton is just a regular guy who deals with **real problems** alongside his superheroic battles.

Itâ€™s also refreshing to see a **grounded, local story** from Marvel. No aliens, no space adventuresâ€”just a guy fighting the **local** mafia. Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m not used to seeing in Marvel comics, and I absolutely loved it.

Honestly, I feel like I _shouldnâ€™t_ be giving this a perfect **3/3**, because itâ€™s probably not the **greatest** comic book story ever written. But it checks every box for what I personally want in a comic: **catchy, funny, and lightweight**.

So, for me, itâ€™s an easy **3/3**.

### **Narrative: 2/2 pts**

The **narrative** of this story is consistently **funny**. There are countless comedic moments throughout the series, and I genuinely find those details hilarious. However, what makes the narrative truly exceptional is how the **storytelling is embedded in the artwork itself**.

Take a look at this absolute **banger** from _Issue #2_:

![Issue 2](assets/images/16-03-2025/i2.png)

There are **14 panels** of Kate saying a single sentence. Meanwhile, Clint is shooting an arrow. This is a **brilliant** way to illustrate how fast Clint aims and firesâ€”without needing a single word to explain it. I love these innovative, **outside-the-box** storytelling techniques that convey action visually rather than relying on narration. **Itâ€™s truly genius.**

Hereâ€™s another fantastic example from _Issue #2_:

![Issue 2](assets/images/16-03-2025/i3.png)

Did you notice how Aja **uses panels within a single larger panel** to show the passage of timeâ€”without having to redraw the same scene three times? Iâ€™ve seen this technique used in other comics before, so I donâ€™t think Aja invented it (or maybe he did? Honestly, I canâ€™t remember where else Iâ€™ve seen it). Regardless, itâ€™s still **brilliant**. We need to see **more** of this in comic books. Absolutely love it.

And last but not least, check out another **great** panel from _Issue #2_:

![Issue 2](assets/images/16-03-2025/i4.png)

I find it **hilarious** that Fraction put Clintâ€™s **thoughts** inside this guyâ€™s **speech bubble**. It makes perfect sense since this issue is narrated from Clintâ€™s point of view. The comic even hints at this narrative style at the beginning of the issue. So, it feels completely natural that instead of reading what this guy is actually saying, weâ€™re reading what **Clint understands** from it.

I love this narrative approach, and I think they **totally** pulled it off. Itâ€™s also a great example of the comedic elements I mentioned earlier.

Overall, the **narrative is flawless** both technically and story-wise. So, itâ€™s an easy **2/2** for me.

_Spoiler Alert_: Iâ€™m not done talking about the narrativeâ€”Iâ€™ll dive into it a bit more in the **bonuses** section.

### **Pre & Post Requirements: 1/1 pts**

Even though this is a **Marvel** comic, you donâ€™t need any prior knowledge to understand whatâ€™s going on. The story is **self-contained**â€”all you need to know is that **Hawkeye is an Avenger**. Thatâ€™s it.

There are no references to external events or crossovers, making this an **easy, standalone read**.

**1/1.**

### **Bonuses**

**Smaller Panels**  
Check out this page from _Issue #2_, where Clint and Kate are talking over the phone.

![Issue 2](assets/images/16-03-2025/i5.png)

Aja dedicated **24 panels** to this single conversation. **24**! And he fit all these panels into a single page. I think this is one of his signature moves. He breaks down short moments into many pieces and explores each moment differently.

For example, other artists might have drawn **3 big panels** for this speech, with several speech bubbles in each one. But for Aja, this is a big **no**. He prefers a **one bubble per panel** approach. This allows him to depict the conversation in a more linear way. We get to see how each participant in the conversation feels and reacts to what the other says.

I think this is a crucial aspect of a **natural conversation** that is almost always overlooked in comics. Of course, larger panels with many speech bubbles require less effort, but in those cases, we miss out on seeing how the characters react differently throughout the conversation.

So, I find Ajaâ€™s approach **genius** and **innovative**. I hope many more comic book artists adopt this signature move of his.

**+1 point to Aja**

**Issue 11**  
_Issue 11_ is a particularly special one. In this issue, we read the story from **Lucky's** (Clint's dog) point of view!

![Issue 11](assets/images/16-03-2025/i6.png)

Look at this **hilarious** panel. Here, we see how Lucky perceives Clint and Kate. Thereâ€™s a semi-censored speech bubble that gives us just enough to understand whatâ€™s going on, but since Lucky is a dog, itâ€™s only partially understood.

![Issue 11](assets/images/16-03-2025/i7.png)

Take a look at this **one-of-a-kind page**! Here, we see Lucky deducing what happened on the rooftop (a murder), almost like a detective. He labels each character involved in the crime scene with a number and tells the story using those numbers. This narrative is **genius**. The fact that Lucky understands the events correctly makes my dayâ€”such a clever boy!

![Issue 11](assets/images/16-03-2025/i8.png)

In this page, Lucky is waiting for Clint to return home. As he sits and waits, he listens (and smells) whatâ€™s going on around him. Personally, this is one of my favorite pages in the series. The small **cat icon** at the bottom left corner cracks me up every time. God, isnâ€™t Lucky the cutest and smartest boy ever?

Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this issue in any other comic book. We view the story from a pet's perspective, and instead of traditional speech or narrative bubbles, the story is told using **icons** and other visual cues. Itâ€™s a **masterpiece** that should be studied in colleges (Iâ€™m serious. There are courses on the universality of icons in communication and design, and this issue would be a great example, in my opinion).

**+1 point for such an innovative issue**

**First-Time Usage of Sign Language in Comics**  
At some point toward the end of the story, Clint loses his ability to hear and becomes partially deaf.

![Issue 19](assets/images/16-03-2025/i10.png)

After Clint goes deaf, **every speech bubble is empty** because he can no longer hear them. I think this is a great way to portray the challenges faced by deaf people. The frustration they experience is illustrated so well that after reading this issue, I found myself **thankful for my health**. Itâ€™s funny how we take such essential things for granted.

But the story must go on. So, they introduced **sign language** to the comic bookâ€”for the first time in history! The guy next to Clint communicates with him using sign language, and this continues for a couple of issues.

This posed a challenge for translators. Should they **re-draw** these panels to translate the sign language? Or should they add a descriptive footnote explaining whatâ€™s being said? The original comic book didnâ€™t include explanatory footnotes for those who donâ€™t know sign language, and this was an **intentional choice**. Including footnotes for translation would ignore the original artistic intent. However, it wasnâ€™t possible to redraw the sign language either because sign language in **English** is shorter than in **Turkish**, so the translated signs wouldnâ€™t fit in the same space. In the end, they left it as it was.

When I read about this challenge, I was **surprised**. What an unusual challenge, proving that this comic book is **one of a kind**!

**+1 point!**

I love seeing new, creative ways to use **drawings** to tell a story in comic books. Because in the end, **thatâ€™s what comics are all about**! This series introduces **three innovative visual narrative techniques** to the comic book world, and I think thatâ€™s why this run is such a **special**, **groundbreaking** comic. I hope we see more innovations like these in future comics!

## **Conclusion: 115/100**

Overall, with the bonuses included, this comic series scored **15/13**, which calculates to **115/100**! I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story, but I **loved** diving into the comics, appreciating the colors and drawings. I canâ€™t wait to see more work from Aja. **Excellent work!**

Thanks for reading my blog. See you next time! ðŸ‘‹
